	* #12654 buggy item after undo

	* #10960 Largely improved locus sampler: faster and more
	accurate. Not yet perfect when tiny sampling step is
	needed. Nevertheless good comprimise with speed.  

	* #12304 Working start script for Linux 64bits architecture
	
	* #10959 "multiple creation" mode need to apply to eraser as well
	
	* #12419 Number uncorrectly rounded. Now the behavior is: 1) float
	are printed rounded to 2 decimals 2)Fraction are still presented
	as Fraction
	
	* #12091 Locus label postion does not udpate

	* Associate an icon to the drgeo.sh start script for linux.
	
	* In the DrGeo world menu, a menu entry to open an arbitrary
	file (text, picture, script)
	
	* #10954 Need of information bar in the bottom of DrGeo
	
	* #10899 Toggle Construct and Move mode
	
	* Implement unicity on Polygon defined by n points
	
	* Smalltalk written sketch, when possible the user can enter
	direct point coordinates, value or vector coordinates, DrGeo will
	turn these as math item in the canvas, for example you can define
	a segment with canvas segment: 0@0 to: 1@1 or canvas
	segment: (canvas point: 0@0 to: (canvas point: 1@1). In the first
	case the point are instantiated but hidden. See the updated
	documentation for more examples.

	New features documented in the user guide:

	* DrGWrappedPoint>>coordinates

	* DrGeoCanvas>>segment:to accept point as well (Wrapped point are
	created on the fly), it covers all curves instantiation, and place
	where vectors and values arguments are used.

	* DrGeoCanvas>>update to update the canvas after a set of items
	was modified
	
	* DrGWrappedItem>>moveTo: move the item to a given point position
	whenever it is meaningful
	
	
2011-02-17  Hilaire Fernandes  <hilaire@ofset.org>

	* Release 11.03

	* #12009: Polygon closestPointTo: mismatch
	* #11633: Implement closestPointTo: for Point mathItem
	* Updated Spanish translation
	* #11877: In Smalltalk programmed figure, define a point position
	with a block closure.
	* #11634: wrong sent message in DrGWrappedCurve
	* #11879: Error with slopeOf: message, wrong assignment
	* #11635: Missing method in DrGeoCanvas
	* #11631: Add dev tool in the DrGeo world menu
	* Transformation class name incorrectly constructed prevented the
	use of any transformation in programmed figure

2010-11-13  Hilaire Fernandes  <hilaire@ofset.org>

	* Release 10.12

	* #10951: "undo" should restore the object's name. Create a point,
	rename it, erase it, and undo. The point is restored but its name
	is no longer displayed. DrGeo seems to remember the name but it
	forgets to redisplay it. It is now fixed.
	* #11146: Invisible items in the style menu. With the Sugar Theme,
	some items of the style menu are invisible: line size and line
	style are by default black with a black background. Solution:
	force to a white background in the menu.
	* #11285: Remove duplicated methods basicType and
	nodeName. basicType and nodeName methods from the MathItem class
	should be merged. It is a duplication for historical reason
	related to the xml save format. These attributes are identical
	except for: arc - arcCircle; ray - halfLine; value -
	numeric. nodeName should be removed. It makes some code (macro
	loading from a xml description) unnecessary complicated.
	* #10882: Extent file format. Extent the current file format to
	support: DrGeo Smalltalk scripting; DrGeo macro and extended
	style. Now Macro and script can be saved/load; moreover the XML
	format is extended to support label and vector positioning and
	extended style.
	* #10957: Creating a circle from segment and point. When creating
	a circle by selecting a segment first, there is a an error. I
	decided to remove this mechanism to create circle. I have hiatus
	because when creating circle, I am using the FlyPointXXXBuilder to
	create on the fly point and to get a live moving circle (we do not
	have this feature in DrGeo 1.1).
	* #10941: The macro and script dialogs now stay on the foreground.
	* #10952: Wrong message in script dialog.
	* #10881: Preview in the file widget. With the file dialog, we
	should have a preview of the user selected DrGeo file.
	* #10880: Icon to quit DrGeo. Currently, to quit the application,
	the user must access to the world Pharo menu then select quit
	without saving. We should have on a the task bar a button to quit
	directly DrGeo. I implemented a DrGreo world menu with the even
	more options: new figure; open a DrGeo file; quit the DrGeo
	environment. It can be extended in the future with more menu
	entries.
	* #11366: Creating a math item already existing but hidden. When
	the user defines an item already existing but hidden, DrGeo
	factory prevents a duplicated definition, so the user will fell
	DrGeo refuses to create the wished item. However the user does not
	have a chance to realize his item is not created because it is
	already defined but hidden. In this case, DrGeo should just
	unhidden the existing item, so the user got the expected feedback.

2008-09-20  Hilaire Fernandes  <hilaire@ofset.org>

	* New bundle based on source code version 148.

	intialization (TextDomainManager registerCategoryPrefix: 'DrGeoII'
	domain: 'DrGeoII'
