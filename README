| WARNING |
+---------+
As the user sketch files are saved within the DrGeo.app directory
structure, upgrading to a newer version may result in lost user files
(the MySketches and MyExports folders contents).

Before installing newer Dr. Geo version, the user must make a backup
of the DrGeo.app/MySketches and DrGeo.app/MyExports folders.

When installing newer version from the Dr. Geo ZIP archive, the user
should request a merging installation. It depends on the Archive
software used to install Dr.Geo. I am note sure yet how to overcome
this issue.

To start Dr. Geo on GNU/Linux, double click on the file DrGeo.sh.
Check the DrGeo.sh file has the execution flag set.

Linux Dr. Geo is compiled for 32 bits host. To run it on your Linux 64 bits host, 
you need to install 32 bits compatibility package. 
This package will let you run any 32 bits compiled software on a 64 bits host. 

Depending on the distribution, the package to install may have different name.

	* Debian < Jessie, Ubuntu, LinuxMint <= 12.04 LTS:

	sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch

	* Debian >= Jessie, Ubuntu, LinuxMint >12.04 LTS:

	Check you are indeed running a 64 bits system and you have access to 32 bits architecture as well:
	
	dpkg --print-architecture
	-> amd64

	dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
	-> <empty>

	Then add the 32 bits compatibility packages:
	sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
	dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
	->i386

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

	Ensure the 32 bits version of Cairo is installed as well:
	sudo apt-get install libcairo2:i386
